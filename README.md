## General Information
- Upgrad AIML course assignment.
- Exploration of CNN architecture and data augmentation techniques using the ISIC dataset.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
-  The results obtained with the data extension showed a significant improvement over previous models, with a training accuracy of 0.9217 over 30 cycles and a validation accuracy of 0.8285. Based on large fluctuations in validation loss, it is recommended to retrain with a reduced learning rate. The model seems to jump around a local minimum. Potential recall, which reduces the learning rate after reaching 0.8 accuracy, may lead to improvements.


## Technologies Used
- tensorflow - version 2.15.0
- keras - version 2.15.0


## Acknowledgements
